            <P>Life Experiance</P>
            <p>In 1992, I started my first career teching music in public schools.  I worked in several school district with each change a step up in prestige and salary. I started in Louisian, MO at a school of under 200 students and finish 12 years later at Northwest R-1, a high school of over 2500 students.</p>

            <p>While teaching music, I worked in various computer repair shops during my summers breaks. In the summer of 2004, Clayton Computer offer me the top management job handling managing three retail & repair shops.</p> 

            <p>In 2010, the owner of Clayton Computer decided he was ready to completely retire. His plan was to sell his three shops. Unfortunatley, he could not find buyers at the price he wanted. I offered to buy one of his stores. He accepted and eventually sold the other two shops, however the new owner did not manage them well and the shops closed a year later.</p>

            <p>I took the shop I purchased and changed the name to "THE SCREEN SAVERS" in 2011. I made a few pricing and marketing changes, as well as, begin repairing cell phones. Since then, I have succefully repair over 6000 computers and over 4000 cell phones.</p>
